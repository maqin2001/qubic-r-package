Introduction
============

QUBIC is a qualitative biclustering algorithm for analyses of gene
expression data authored by @li09. We now give the new
implementation in R.

1.  gene expression data is very important in XXX

2.  large-scale microarray data and RNA-seq data provide good
    opportunity to do gene co-expression analyses? meanwhile the
    effective and efficient algorithms are needed to implement such
    analysis.

3.  Substantial efforts have been made in this field, such as XX, XX,
    XXX, among which XX has the R package implementation?It is worth
    noting that our in-house algorithm, QUBIC, is reviewed as one of the
    best programs in terms of their prediction performance on benchmark
    datasets. Most importantly, it is the best one regarding real
    biological data. (cite this paper:
    http://bib.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2012/07/06/bib.bbs032.full)

4.  Currently, QUBIC is already cited for XX times and in 2012 we also
    developed a web server, QServer, to facilitate the users without
    comprehensive computational background (cite Qserver paper). As the
    scale of gene expression data keeps increasing, we developed this R
    package of QUBIC to void submitting large data to a webserver.

5.  The unique features of our R package:

    a.  Updated and more stable back-end resource code, written by C++,
        which has better memory control and is more efficient than the
        one published in 2009.

    b.  Comprehensive functions, including XX, XX, XX

Implementation
==============

QUBIC (QUBIC 1.0) original written in C using POSIX apis. The
portability is limited. Some memory leak will be occur if trying to call
the primarily functions more than once.

We did refactoring and rewrite most part of QUBIC 1.0 and try to keep
the result is the same.

The performance is increased.

The R package could be working with biclust written by @kaiser09.

We also give examples of heat map and overlapping networks.

Functions and examples
======================

There are three functions provide by QUBIC package. ```BCQU()``` makes
following...
```{r}
    library(QUBIC);

    test <- matrix(rnorm(5000),100,50)
    test[11:20,11:20] <- rnorm(100,3,0.3)
    res<-biclust(test, method = BCQU())
    summary(res)
```


We can also draw heat maps.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# draw a single bicluster using drawHeatmap {bicust}
data(BicatYeast)
res <- biclust(BicatYeast, BCQU(), verbose = FALSE)
# Draw heatmap of the first cluster
drawHeatmap(BicatYeast, res, 1)

# Conclusions
```

QUBIC is a well known qualitative biclustering algorithm. QUBIC package
should serve and save time for bioinformatics scientists.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax
for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on
using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that
includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code
chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
