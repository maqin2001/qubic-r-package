# Introduction

QUBIC is a qualitative biclustering algorithm for analyses of gene expression data authored by @li09. We now give the new implementation in R. 

# Implementation

QUBIC (QUBIC 1.0) original written in C using POSIX apis. The portability is limited. Some memory leak will be occur if trying to call the primarily functions more than once.

We did refactoring and rewrite most part of QUBIC 1.0 and try to keep the result is the same. 

The performance is increased. 

The R package could be working with biclust written by @kaiser09.

We also give examples of heat map and overlapping networks.

# Functions and examples

There are three functions provide by QUBIC package. ```BCQU()``` makes following...

```{r}
library(QUBIC);
test <- matrix(rnorm(5000),100,50)
test[11:20,11:20] <- rnorm(100,3,0.3)
res<-biclust(test, method = BCQU())
summary(res)
```

We can also draw heat maps.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# draw a single bicluster using drawHeatmap {bicust}
data(BicatYeast)
res <- biclust(BicatYeast, BCQU(), verbose = FALSE)
# Draw heatmap of the first cluster
drawHeatmap(BicatYeast, res, 1)

# Conclusions
```

QUBIC is a well known qualitative biclustering algorithm. QUBIC package should serve and save time for bioinformatics scientists.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
